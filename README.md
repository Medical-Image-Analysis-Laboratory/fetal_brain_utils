# Readme
This repo is still much of a WIP.
- In particular, it uses various conventions for reading BIDS directories (csv listing, bidslayout, `sub_ses_dict`). This should be harmonized. 
- The outputs with mialsrtk, nesvor and niftymic are not consistently formatted. This should be revised. 
- This repository should be made public and incorporated as a dependency for other repositories like `fetal_brain_qc`.
